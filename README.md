# SOP_Generator
A generator of Statement of Purpose (SOP) for grad schools.
The script generates multiple PDF files from a generic LaTex template.

I created this project when I applied for multiple grad schools because it was troublesome to edit a lot of SOPs.

The script needs a LaTex compiler like MikTex or LaTex installed.

## How to run:
$ python ./generator.py
