I have a strong desire to pursue a Ph.D. so I can perform high-impact research in computer science. My interests include \researchinterests. I have been working with Professor Insik Shin on performance, energy efficiency, and wireless networking on mobile systems. I have published two full papers~\cite{ebrowser, greenbag} in top-tier conferences (ACM MobiCom and IEEE RTSS) as the first author. Furthermore, my programming skills have been honed during internships at some of the world's largest technology corporations (Microsoft, Google, and Samsung). For my research results, I was rewarded with the prestigious Qualcomm Innovation Award and a Naver Ph.D. Fellowship.
I believe that doing a Ph.D. in the U.S. would allow me to fully exploit my potential.
