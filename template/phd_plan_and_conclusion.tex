I am impressed by Stanford's superior research quality and innovations in computer architecture and networking. I especially find the projects of the following professors incredibly exciting and fully aligned with my research interests: Professors Christos Kozyrakis and Philip Levis (OS and distributed systems); Professors Nick McKeown and Sachin Katti (networking). Therefore, I sincerely want to join the Computer Science Ph.D. program at Stanford University.
