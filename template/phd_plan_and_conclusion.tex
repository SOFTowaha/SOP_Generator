I am impressed by Stanford's superior research quality and innovations in computer architecture and networking. I especially find the projects of the following professors incredibly exciting and fully aligned with my research interests: Professors Christos Kozyrakis and Philip Levis (OS and distributed systems); Professors Nick McKeown and Sachin Katti (networking). Therefore, I sincerely want to join the Computer Science Ph.D. program at Stanford University.

\remove{In my Ph.D. study, I plan to do research on improving performance, efficiency, and scalability of networking and computer systems, ranging from mobile devices to large-scale datacenters.
I want to build and conduct rigorous studies on practical and robust systems.
I believe with the experience in my previous research projects on smartphones I can make further contributions to the field.
%on many techniques developed for smartphones are still applicable from large-scale datacenters. 
%Many of the low-power techniques developed for mobile devices directly benefit general-purpose servers
% with empirical methods rather than very theoretical approach with pure mathematical proofs.
% For example, I want to develop techniques to increase the scale of existing datacenters by multiple times.
%I believe all my experience in mobile systems are still helpful. There are many principles that can naturally apply from energy-scarce mobile systems to datacenters. 

I am impressed by Stanford's superior research quality and innovations in computer architecture and networking. Among research groups at Stanford, I especially find the projects of Professors Christos Kozyrakis, Philip Levis, Sachin Katti, and Nick McKeown incredibly exciting and fully aligned with my research interests.
For these reasons, I firmly believe that Computer Science Ph.D. program at Stanford is the ideal place for me.
%The dynamic culture and diversity of CS Department is really appealing.
% research is the most advanced in the Computer Science field. Research at Stanford aim for novel and big impact.

\remove{In my Ph.D. study, I would like to do research on networking on mobile systems and datacenters. This includes "improving web performance for wired and mobile clients." (ravi)

The location of Stanford at the Silicon Valley is ideal for research because there are many inspiration and ideas at the edge of the computer industry. I like the liberal thinking and cooperation at Stanford. I want to continue my studies at Stanford because the quality of the research here is the most advanced in the Computer Science field. It is indeed ranked in top 1 in all ranking systems I have read. Unlike other schools which aim for low-hanging results, research at Stanford aim for novel and big impact. I especially find the work of Professor \textbf{Balakrishnan} very exciting and align with my research interests on systems and networking. The dynamic culture and diversity of CS Department is really appealing. For these reasons, I would like to join the Computer Science Ph.D. program at MIT.}
