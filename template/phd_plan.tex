I aspire to do research on improving the performance, efficiency, and security of distributed systems, computer networks, and mobile systems. I want to build robust and efficient operating systems, network infrastructures, and software systems for large-scale networked applications. I am interested in practical implementations with deep analysis and strong theoretical backgrounds. I have confidence that my previous experience in the energy efficiency and networking on mobile systems will be helpful to make further contributions to the field.
