I am impressed by Stanford's superior research quality and innovations in computer architecture and distributed systems. I especially find the projects of Professors Christos Kozyrakis and Philip Levis (OS and distributed systems) as well as Professors Nick McKeown and Sachin Katti (computer networks) incredibly exciting and fully aligned with my research interests. For the above reasons, I sincerely want to join the Computer Science Ph.D. program at Stanford University.
